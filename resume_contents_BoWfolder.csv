While working for Beauty Brands I received two awards. I received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year. The Award of
Excellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district. Out of seven locations I was chosen for my district. I was
presented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City. I accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in

district.
Experience
I have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I
at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle
School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education
and special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers
and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing
order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various
problems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€​ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the
board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem
on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together
and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.
